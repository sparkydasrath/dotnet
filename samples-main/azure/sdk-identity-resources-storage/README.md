# Azure Identity, Resource Management, and Storage sample

This sample console application accomplishes the following tasks using the Azure SDK for .NET:

* Creates a `DefaultAzureCredential` to represent the app's credentials.
* Creates a resource group.
* Creates a storage account in the resource group.
* Uploads an image to the storage account using a storage connection string.
* Uploads an image to the storage account using `DefaultAzureCredential`.
* Deletes the resource group and all of its contents.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample uses preview packages for *Azure.ResourceManager.Resource* and *Azure.ResourceManagement.Storage*. *Azure.Identity* and *Azure.Storage.Blobs* are generally available.

## Prerequisites

* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

## Prepare to run the sample

Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to create and get client secret credentials:

1. Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name>
    ```

    Output:

    ```json
    {
        "appId": "generated-app-ID",
        "displayName": "sample-app-name",
        "name": "http://sample-app-name",
        "password": "random-password",
        "tenant": "tenant-ID"
    }
    ```

    This creates a service principal. This is an identity for your app to use to perform Azure operations. The service principal is created with the *Contributor* role by default.

1. Assign the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role to the new service principal. Use the URL in the `name` property from the output in the previous step, including `http://`.

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --assignee <sample-app-name-url>
    ```

    This will allow the service principal to perform blob data operations using Azure.Identity (as opposed to a connection string)

1. Use the returned credentials from the first step to set the following environment variables.

    |Variable name|Description|Value|
    |-|-|-|
    |`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`|Service principal's app identifier|`appId`|
    |`AZURE_TENANT_ID`|Identifier of the principal's Azure Active Directory tenant|`tenant`|
    |`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`|Client app secret|`password`|

    Azure.Identity reads these values from the environment at runtime to create a `DefaultAzureCredential` object.

1. Get the account details of the subscription you want to use for this sample.

    ```azurecli
    az account show
    ```

    Output:

    ```json
    {
      "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
      "homeTenantId": "tenant-id",
      "id": "subscription-id",
      "isDefault": true,
      "managedByTenants": [],
      "name": "subscriptionName",
      "state": "Enabled",
      "tenantId": "tenant-id",
      "user": {
        "cloudShellID": true,
        "name": "user@contoso.com",
        "type": "user"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Set an environment variable named `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` using the `id` property of the information retrieved in the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
> Environment variables can be set in your operating system, or you can use a [*launchSettings.json* file](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-3.1#lsj).

## Run the sample

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Clean up the service principal

You should remove unused service principals. Use the URL in the `name` property from the output in the first step, including `http://`.

```azurecli
az ad sp delete --id <sample-app-name-url>
```
